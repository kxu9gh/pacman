Projects for cs188

## Search
In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I built general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

## Multi-Agent Search
In this project, I designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, I implemented both minimax and expectimax search and design evaluation function.

## Reinforcement Learning
In this project, I implemented value iteration and Q-learning. I tested my agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

## Ghostbusters(tracking)
Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were not always so. Legend has it that many years ago, Pacmanâ€™s great grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was blinded by his power and could only track ghosts by their banging and clanging.

A neural network to classify digits, and more!
